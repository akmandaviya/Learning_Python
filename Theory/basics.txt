*** python is case sensitive language***

~>Data-types in python:
(1)Number-->integer
(2)Number-->float
(3)String
(4)Boolean-->True/False


~> Taking user input from user:
   We have to use 'input' function to take user input and should store the output in some variable to show on screen 
    Ex: input("What is your name?")
         print(name)


~> Type conversion:
   We need type-conversion,because in python when we give input its always in string format.
   Be it a number,float, or boolean everthing will be in string format.
